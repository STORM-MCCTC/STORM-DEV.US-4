        <p>AI should be not be used for a replacement for human creativity. I believe that AI can never recreate the soul in Writing and Art that humans can. AI should be used a tool to stimulate learning, instead of asking chatgpt to do this for me, you should ask to explain how this works and help me understand it. AI can be a tool for learning but as easily can be used to Skip the process of learning, if you use AI to do things for you then it defeats the purpose. In conclusion AI can be an amazing tool for helping you learn but at the same time using AI to much can cause you to grow dependent to it.</p>

        <h3>AI Review:</h3>
        <p>This piece expresses a strong and clear opinion about the relationship between AI and human creativity. You do a great job of communicating your belief that AI should support learning, not replace it. The message is thoughtful and shows genuine reflection — which gives your writing a strong personal voice.</p>

        <p>Here are a few areas to focus on as you keep improving:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grammar and word choice:</strong> There are a few small issues like “should be not be” (should not be) and “a tool” missing “as.” Fixing those will make your ideas come through more clearly.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentence flow:</strong> Some sentences are long or repetitive — breaking them up can make your points land harder and make the post easier to read.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency in tone:</strong> The overall tone is reflective and sincere, but small shifts (like capitalizing “Skip”) can interrupt that flow. Keeping your tone steady strengthens your argument.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall: <em>Good message and conviction.</em> You clearly care about the topic and communicate your ideas well. With a little editing for flow and grammar, this could read as a strong, concise argument on how AI should be used responsibly in education.</p>
