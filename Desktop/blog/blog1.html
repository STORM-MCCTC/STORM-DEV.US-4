        <p>What is this for and why? Im am really bad at writing i mean very f**king bad, im using this website as somewhere i can put all my bad writing and such on this website, idk if i will use this all that much but idrc, maybe doing this will fix my dependice on AI when trying to write. the topics on here will be what im thinking of in the moment and not always align with what i may think down the line, also some topics here may be NSFW or Sexual in nature, i will tag them as such if that is the case.</p>

        <p>I will have AI review my writing and tell me what I should work on below, the following was writen by ChatGPT:</p>

        <h3>AI Review:</h3>
        <p>Honestly, this first post does a great job of setting expectations and being authentic. The tone feels real — casual, blunt, and personal — which works perfectly for a blog like this. You sound like yourself, and that’s more important than perfect grammar.</p>

        <p>That said, here are a few writing points to work on:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Try to clean up small grammar errors (“Im am” → “I’m”, “dependice” → “dependence”) so your readers don’t get distracted from your message.</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Break longer sentences into shorter ones when you feel like you’re rambling — it makes your voice hit harder.</li>
        <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Don’t undersell yourself too much. Saying you’re bad at writing is fine for humor, but remember that this post already shows good tone and personality — that’s the core of writing well.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall: <em>Strong start.</em> It’s honest, it’s human, and it feels like the beginning of something that could grow into a great habit. Keep writing exactly like this — just with a bit more polish each time.</p>
